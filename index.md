# Welcome To IOPPN's Unofficial Neuroscience & Psychology Handbook ⠀👋

Or should we call it handsite? Anyhow, here we present a collection of community notes for key modules covered during the Yr1 of Neuroscience and Psychology BSc programme at King's College London.

It is entirely student-run, ergo, not affiliated with nor endorsed by the University. Although we cannot promise any guarantees as to the correctness of content, we will strive to maintain top-notch notes through super rigorous industry-grade peer reviews.

# Sharing Is Caring ⠀🫂

We encourage pull requests from anyone who is happy to share their notes, such that everyone on our course can benefit from well-written full-coverage content. And of course, feel free to provide appropriate attribution per page created!
