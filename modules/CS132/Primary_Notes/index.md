# Welcome to the CS132 revision guide

## Topics and content

In the words of Matt, **all of the above topics are examinable**. However, there
are varying degrees of usefulness for each of the topics - if something is not
deemed overly useful, it will typically be omitted in the notes. For example,
for processor architecture topic, most proprietary knowledge will likely be
omitted (for example, specific operations of the circuit).
