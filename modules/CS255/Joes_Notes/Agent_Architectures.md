## Agent architectures 

### Body
The agent interacts with the environment through the body

The body:
* Perceives stimuli form the environment and creates precepts for the controller
* Receives commands form the controller and generates actions on the environment
* In some cases may have actions that are not controlled

### Controller
The controller is the brains of the agent and generates commands based on current and previous precepts.
Controllers have a limited memory and computational resources

### Agent logic
#### Traces
* **Percept Trace** A sequence of all percepts, past present and future.
* **Command Trace** A sequence of all commands, past present and future.
* **Agent History** A sequence of past and present commands and precepts at to time $$t$$.
* **transduction** A function from percept traces to command traces.
* **History** Percepts to time $$t$$ (including time $$t$$) + Commands to time $$t$$ = History at $$t$$
* **Causal transduction** History at time $$t$$ -> Command at $$t$$
* **Controller** An implementation of a causal transduction.

#### Belief Status
An agent has limited memory 

It must decide what subset of its history to remember

This is the agents **memory**

At every step the controller needs to decide
1. What to do
2. What to remember

A belief status should approximate the environment
### Single level hierarchy
In a single level hierarchy the agent has one body and a single controller.

#### functions
* **Belief state function** controls the next belief state / memories.
* **Command state function** decides on the commands the controller should produce.

#### Advantages
Simpler and can be easier to program

#### Disadvantages
All problems are processes together, e.g collision detection and long term planning

This can slow down the goals that need a quick response time

### Multi level hierarchy

Made from a body and many layers of controllers.

Each controller acts as a virtual body to the controller above. It receives precepts and commands from the controller below it and sends selected precepts and commands to the controller above.

### functions
* **Belief state function** controls the next belief state / memories.
* **Command state function** decides on the commands the controller should produce.
* **Precept function** decides what commands to send to the higher controller

### Agent Types
#### Ideal Mapping
In principle an agent can be though of as an mapping from the set of precepts to the set of commands. There is a theoretical **Ideal mapping** where the ideal action is taken at each step.
The simple approach would be a lookup table:
* Table too large
* Time to build

The goal of an agent is to approximate this ideal mapping 

#### Simple Reflex agents
Simple agents based on a series of if -> else statements

Can achieve fairly complex behavior.

Can be run quickly

#### Reflex agent with State
similar to the simple Reflex Agents but retains knowledge

Needs an internal state

Can keep track of a changing world
#### Goal based agents
Keeps track of what is trying to be achieved

More flexible than a reflex agent

#### Utility based agents

Uses a **Utility function** to judge the state of the world

Allows for a choice of which goals to achieve and can select the one with the highest utility.

If goal outcomes are uncertain a probability formula can be used.


#### Learning Agent
Adds in several components
* **critic** Using a **performance standard** informs the learning agent how well it is doing.
* **performance element** responsible for acting based on the improvements from the learning agent.
* **learning element** responsible for making improvements with knowledge of the agents success.
* **problem generator** responsible for suggesting actions for new experiences to attempt to prevent being stuck at a local maximum

Takes information about hove the performance agent is doing and attempts to optimise the agent to improve performance.
Learning provides the agent with autonomy.
