Usability is Money

Users will have a poor experience and they won't use the site again 

Should consider usability for all users not just the developer 

### Rules of Interaction Design

* Understand the Computer - Limitations, capacities tools and platforms
* Understand People - Phycology, social aspects and human error
* Understand Human Error - Human Error is common

An unclear interface is often blamed on user error when it is actually designer error

User centered design
1. Put the user first
2. Keep the user in the centre
2. Remember the user at the end

## Software Development Lifecycle
1. Requirements capture
2. Design
3. implementation
4. Verification
5. Maintenance

### Requirements Capture 

#### Elicitation
work with the stakeholder
Interviews and Questionnaires - ask users
Ethnography - observe users
Scenarios & stories - real life examples

#### Types of Requirements
* Functional
    * A service provided by the system
    * What it should not do
* Non Functional
    * Constrains on the functions
    * can affect the whole system

#### Specification
What the system does not how it does it

Describe using:
* Natural Language - easy for anyone
* Structured Language - pseudoscope
* graphical notation - paper prototypes
    * Cheap and easy to create
    * easy to edit
* Design language - Cant be used by everyone
* Mathematical specification - very precise

## Usability
* Learn-ability - How easy it to accomplish basic tasks on first encounter
* Efficiency - Once users have performed the design, how quicly can they perform tasks?
* Memorability - When users return to the interface how easily can they use it again
* Errors - How many, What are they , Are they recoverable
* Satisfaction - How pleasant is the design 

### Visibility
How easy is it for the user to recognize and use a control function. A more visible function is easier to use. Position of the controls and what they do is also important 

### Affordance
Properties of an object, what can be done with it.

When you first see something how do you know what to do with it?
* Text
* Icons
* Instructions

Don't make non-working buttons or things that don't look like buttons

### Constraints
Limiting the cations the user can take at any one time

Common is deactivating certain menu options by shading and restricting use

* __Physical__ - DVDs , USB, Keyboard : can only be pressed
* __Logical__ - The users understanding of how the world works and allows the user to deduce what happens next
* __Cultural__ - Cultural conventions: A red light means stop / warning almost anywhere it is shown in the western world but in China celebrates new year and brings good luck. This is a result of culture and fairly arbitrary not any form of logical process. 

### Feedback
Gives the user a response to an action and what has been accomplished could be
* __Visual__ - hourGlass , new page load
* __Auditory__ - Beep on mistake
* __Tactile__ - Keyboard , vibration
* __Verbal__ - Warnings or welcome messages

### Mapping 
Relationship between the controls and their effect

__Good__ - Steering Wheels, Slider Bars

__Poor__ - Taps: which side , Light switch: Which light?

### Consistency 
Similar operations for similar tasks

Cut and pase in the same menu
File Menu top left

Similar both within systems and cross systems / applications (Xbox controller and PlayStation are similar)

## Usability Heuristics
* __Visibility of System Status__ - Keep users informed of status by providing feedback e.g 1/10 
* __Match Between system and Real World__- Use user's language rather than systems terms
* __User Control and Freedom__ = Provide "escape routes" for users (undo)
* __Consistency and Standards__ - Avoid making users wonder if deferent terms mean the same thing (apply / save)
* __Error prevention__ - Prevent users form making errors (Do you want to save)
* __Recognition rather then recall__ - Make objects ,actions and objects visible
* __Flexibility and Efficiency of use__ - Provide accelerators that allow experts to do things faster
* __Aesthetic and Minimalist Design__ - Avoid irrelevant functions or information
* __Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from error__ - Use Plain language to describe the error. Be informative and non-technical
* __Help and Documentation__ - Provide information that is easily searched and provides solutions

## Accessibility and the Web
Inclusive practice of making websites usable for all abilities

Required by Equality Act 2010
* Meet level AA of the web content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
* Otherwise: you could be sued for discrimination

The site should
* Programed using semantically meaningful HTML
* Has text equivalents for images
* Meaningful link names

### Needs
__Visual__ - Blindness, poor vision , colour Blindness
__Motor__ - Fine motor control , tremors, slowness
__Auditory__ - Deafness
__Seizures__ - Epilepsy form flashing lights
__Cognitive__ - Learning difficulties (dyslexia,dyscalculia) memory problems

### Examples
* Making images/ text enlargeable with functionality or browser CSS
* Underline Links - for colour blind people
* Make clickable areas large - Helps users with poor motor control

### Assistive Technologies
* __Screen Reading Software__ - Reads to the user with synthesized speech
* __Braille Terminals__ - Outputs text as Braille
* __Screen Magnification__
* __Speech Recognition__
* __Large TrackBalls__

### WCAG
Web content accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are published by the Web Accessibility initiative 
WCAG 2.0 published in 2008 and became an ISO standard in 2012
WCAG 2.1 published in 2018

### Principles Behind the Quidlines
* __Perceivable__ - Information should pe presented to users in ways they can perceive
* __Operable__ - User interface components and navigation must be operable
* __Understandable__ - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable 
* __Robust__ - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Evaluation and Testing

### Evaluation
* Gather Data about the usability of the design
    * what the user does
    * The characteristics of the user
    * The environment and the context where the evaluation will take place
    * The nature of the artefact being examined

Types of evaluation
* __Formative Evaluation__ - Evaluation of an existing product, Predictive evaluation
* __Summative Evaluation__ - Evaluation at the completion of a product

Evaluation should be done regularly and after each step in the product design development and testing.

### Analytical Evaluation
Include Keystroke Model
Measure
* k (Key-stroking)
* P (Pointing)
* H (Homing)
* D (Drawing)
* M (Mental timing of the operator)
* R (Response time fo the system)

### Observational Evaluation
* Observer users interacting with the system
* Users complete a et of predetermined tasks
* Users can be asked to "Think aloud" - give description of what they are doing and thinking about
* Their thoughts are analysed later
* Assess the extent of System functionality
* Assess the effect of the interface on the user
* Identify specific problems

### Usability Testing
* Introduce a list of tasks
* Watch Quietly
* Record behavior (take notes, recorded)

### Measuring Usability
* Ratio of successes to failures
* Time to compete a task
* Number of errors made
* Number fo times the user expresses frustration
