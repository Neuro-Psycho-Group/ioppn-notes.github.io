        * Check that validation is working correctly
* Usability Testing
    * Is navigation easy
    * Is the content correct
    * Links to help docs
* Compatibility Testing
    * Across browsers

        * Firefox
        * Safari
        * ...
    * Mobile Devices
    * What happens on unsupported browsers?
* Performance Testing
    * How fast is the application?
    * Can the site be optimized?
        * Caching data/ assets
        * More Efficient queries
* Security Testing
    * SQL , XSS injection attacks
    * Update policy
    * Software stack, correct settings, updated software etc...

### Test Driven Development

Writing code to satisfy tests

Should know what your code need to do before it is written

Write the test before writing the code

* Red
    * Write a failing test, should stat what needs to happen
* Green
    * Code Meeds the test
* Refactor
    * Make the code safe, secure and beautiful

Run Test frequently 

Tests can be run automatically on submission to the central repository

## Modern Web
Not always written in PHP

Facebook use a PHP -> C++ compiler for performance reasons

PHP Frameworks can do the heavy lifting

Other language
* Ruby on rails
* Scala

* __Active Record__ - Object relational mapping for database entities
* __ActiveResource__ - For web services
* __ActionMailer__ - Manages Email Functionality

This then compiles down to css

## Back End

* Looks at you language / framework handles background jobs
* Look at cloud based storage
* Ensure you can use web services
* Work out how to do proper performance testing
* Learn about the software stack
