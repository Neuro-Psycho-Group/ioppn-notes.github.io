## [The live site is accessible here](https://ioppn-notes.netlify.app/)



## Introduction

This website presents a collection of notes for Yr1 Neuroscience and Psychology modules at King's College London.

It is entirely student-run, ergo, not affiliated with nor officially endorsed by the University. Although we cannot promise any guarantees as to the correctness of content, we strive to maintain top-notch notes through hyper-rigorous industry-grade peer reviews.

## Note from the maintainer

If you've been linked to this site, you've probably also seen the appeal for widespread contributions. Now, I realise that many people are likely hesitant to showcase their notes online, whether it be because they think others seeing their revision material may indirectly disadvantage them, or that they don't think anything they make is good enough to be hosted on publicly - I was too! However, there are a couple of points I'd like to raise to encourage you to share and help this site become the goto source for revision prep:

1. Our course isn't marked on a curve, so others using your notes to learn doesn't academically detriment you
2. Making notes is a great way to revise, as it makes sure you properly understand the content, and if you know you‚Äôre putting them somewhere public it gives you accountability to actually get them done
3. Any content that is contributed is great to have - it doesn't have to be perfect! The beauty of these open-source projects is that they inherently foster collaboration - all of us can work together to improve any knowledge gaps we may have
4. You'll receive a neat icon of your profile listed under the contributors section of the README and index pages!

## Licensing and downloading

This work is licensed under Creative Commons "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International", and [the full license document can be found here](./LICENSE.txt). Essentially, attribute any content to the people who made it, don't use it to make money, and, even if you change the content, share it under the same license.

If you want to take a local download of the repository, please consider taking a fork as opposed to a clone, as that means it is easier for you to both stay up to date, and to contribute later if you want to. Furthermore, it helps maintainers see how many people are interested in what we are doing.

## Contributing

We encourage pull requests from anyone who is happy to share their notes, such that everyone on our course can benefit from well-written full-coverage content at a faster rate.

### Guidelines for contributions

A full tutorial for contributors can be found [here](https://warwick.guide/CSRGContributing/index.md)

To ensure the smooth running of the this project, and avoid any contributions having to be removed, please follow the below guidelines:

- Please thoroughly research a topic/correction before making a pull request on the matter, to ensure accuracy

- If you are directly sourcing content that is not your own, **please add the correct citations**. For images or text taken verbatim from a source, please include a link to the site it is taken from, and exercise common sense for other cases

- Please do not re-host any university owned content, including but not limited to past papers and lecture notes


## Style guide

The style guide can be found [here](https://warwick.guide/CSRGContributing/styleguide.html)

We will appreciate if contributors abide by these formatting guidelines, as it ensures that the layout of the website is perfect. That said, nothing will break if you don't do so, just certain things (table of contents) won't be as user friendly as it should be.
